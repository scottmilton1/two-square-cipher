"""An implementation of the two-square cipher.

This program encypts and decrypts messages using the two-square cipher,
aka double Playfair.There are two variations of the cipher, vertical
and horizontal, depending on how the two Playfair tables are arranged.
This implementation uses the first variation, so the two tables are
placed vertically.

The functionality of this program can also be used as a module.
